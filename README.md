# Message-encryption
I was reading a book and came across a description of Morse code and thought I wanted to do the same thing, only my own.

The file "crypt" encrypts the message, you have to run it and enter the text. The console will give you a cipher that you can send to the interlocutor.

File "decrypt" decrypts the cipher, you need to open it and under the comment insert the cipher, there are empty brackets. Inserted - run and you will see in the console decrypted text.

The code has Russian and English alphabet, in upper and lower case. Also numbers and some punctuation marks.
